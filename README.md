# 🎓 Admission Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the probability of a student's admission based on academic and profile features. The goal is to assist students in understanding their chances and help universities with data-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I built a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to predict student admission chances using variables such as:

GRE Score

TOEFL Score

University Rating

Statement of Purpose (SOP)

Letter of Recommendation (LOR)

CGPA

Research Experience
